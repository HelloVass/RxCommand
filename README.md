### Demo

![login](./screenshot/login.png) 

Suppose we need to make a login page.

* When the phone number is illegal, the **Fetch Captcha** button is disable
* When the captcha is being acquired, the **Fetch Captcha** button is disable and displays loading
* When fetching captcha  successfully, the countdown starts, the **Fetch Captcha** button is still disable, the countdown ends, the button is enable again
* When fetching captcha failed, the countdown is not started and the **Fetch Captcha** button restores the enable state
* When the phone number and captcha are valid, the **Login** button is  clickable, otherwise it can not be clicked
* When starting login command, the **Login** button is in disable state, and a loading showing.
* When the login  successful, hide loading, jump to the MainActivity.
